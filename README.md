## Getting Started
To get started with this repository:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohamdalwadi/CPlusPlusInterviewPrep.git
   cd CPlusPlusInterviewPrep
   ```

2. **Explore the Directory Structure**: Navigate through the folders to find questions and solutions based on your study needs.

## Repository Structure

### Questions
This directory contains all the interview questions categorized into two main types:

#### Theory
Theoretical questions are further divided into specific topics:
- **Basics/**: Fundamental concepts of C++
- **OOPs/**: Object-Oriented Programming principles
- **DataStructures/**: Various data structures used in C++
- **MemoryManagement/**: Techniques for managing memory in C++
- **AdvancedTopics/**: More complex topics like templates and STL

Each file in these folders includes:
- The question statement
- An explanation of the concept
- Sample answers or explanations

#### Practical
This folder contains practical coding challenges that require writing code. Each file includes:
- The problem statement
- Constraints and examples
- Complete C++ code solution with comments explaining key parts

### Resources
This section provides additional materials to aid in preparation, including:
- **books.md**: Recommended books on C++ and algorithms.
- **websites.md**: Links to coding practice websites (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
- **video_tutorials.md**: Links to useful video tutorials and courses on C++.
