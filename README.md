# Comprehensive Guide to C++

This guide provides a structured overview of C++ concepts, ranging from the basics to advanced topics, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the Standard Template Library (STL), Design Patterns, and Modern C++ features.

## 1. C++ Basics
### 1.1 Syntax and Structure
- **Data Types**
- **Variables**
- **Operators**
- **Control Structures**
  - `if`, `switch`, loops
### 1.2 Functions
- **Function Overloading**
- **Default Arguments**
- **Inline Functions**
### 1.3 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance**
  - Single Inheritance
  - Multiple Inheritance
  - Multilevel Inheritance
  - Hierarchical Inheritance
  - Hybrid Inheritance
- **Polymorphism**
  - Compile-time (Function Overloading, Operator Overloading)
  - Runtime (Virtual Functions)
- **Encapsulation**

## 2. Advanced C++ Features
### 2.1 Templates
- **Function Templates**
- **Class Templates**
### 2.2 Exception Handling
- Try, Catch, Throw
### 2.3 Namespaces
### 2.4 Smart Pointers
- Unique Pointer
- Shared Pointer
- Weak Pointer

## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
### 3.1 Basic Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Regular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Graphs (Representation: Adjacency Matrix/List)
### 3.2 Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Recursion and Backtracking

## 4. Standard Template Library (STL)
### 4.1 Containers
- **Sequence Containers**: Vector, List, Deque
- **Associative Containers**: Set, Map, Multiset, Multimap
- **Unordered Containers**: Unordered Set, Unordered Map
### 4.2 Algorithms

- Searching Algorithms: `find()`, `binary_search()`
### 4.3 Iterators
- Input Iterators
- Output Iterators
- Forward Iterators
- Bidirectional Iterators
- Random Access Iterators

## 5. Design Patterns in C++
### 5.1 Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related objects.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object.

### 5.2 Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object.

### 5.3 Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Interpreter**: Evaluates sentences in a language.
- **Iterator**: Traverses elements of a collection without exposing its structure.
- **Mediator**: Reduces chaotic dependencies between objects.
- **Memento**: Saves and restores the previous state of an object.
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects about changes in another object.
- **State**: Alters behavior based on internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass.

## 6. Best Practices and Principles
### 6.1 SOLID Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 7. Modern C++ Features
- Lambda Expressions
- Concurrency Support (Threads, Mutexes)
- Range-based for loops

## 8. Tools and Libraries
### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
* Visual Studio 
* CLion 
* Code::Blocks 

### Build Systems 
* CMake 
* Makefiles
